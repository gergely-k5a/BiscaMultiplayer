## Overview
Bisca is a Portuguse card game that focuses on winning card-tricks. The game
is popular in many countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, Cape Verde, Angola, etc. The game is similar to its Italian equivalent, Briscola.

The origins of Bisca are unclear, but it is believed to have originated from the Italian equivalent during a period of cultural exchange between the two countries 
in the 16th century.

The game starts with both players being dealt three cards, and one additional card being drawn as the trump card.
